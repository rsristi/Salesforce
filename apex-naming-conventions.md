## Overview

We recommend following Java standards for naming, that is, classes start with a capital letter, methods start with a lowercase verb, and variable names should be meaningful.


## Object Names and custom Fields:
Just look at standard Salesforce objects. None of them start with Upper_Case_With_Underscores.

## Classes:

## Variables/properties/methods in Apex


## Triggers:


## Visualforce pages and components:

## Controllers:

Follow standard salesforce objets and fields naming conventions. Example all lookup and master-detail relationship fields should be LookupObjectNameId__c, ParentObjectNameId__c



## Test methods in test classes
