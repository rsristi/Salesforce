Products are represented by Product2 objects
Products are the individual items  or services  that you sell to customers  
through  your opportunites and quotes. 
You can create a product and  associate it with a price in  a pricebook. 
Each product can exist in many different  pricebooks  with many different prices. 


A Price Book is a list of products and their associated  prices . 
Each Product and it’s price is called  apricebook entry. 
Pricebooks are represented by Pricebook2 objects. 

Note: 
 
1) PricebookEntry is a junction object between Pricebook2 and Product2. 
2) OpportunityLineItem is a junction object between PricebookEntry 
andOpportunity. 
 
Helpful code:
Product2 product1 = new Product2();         
product1.name = 'Test Prod1';         
insert product1;                     

//adding a price book entry                      
PriceBookEntry pricebk = new PriceBookEntry();         
pricebk.CurrencyIsoCode = 'USD';         
pricebk.UnitPrice = 1.0;         
pricebk.Pricebook2Id =[select id,name from PriceBook2 where name like 'Standard Price B ook' limit 1].id;         
pricebk.Product2Id = product1.id;         
pricebk.IsActive = true;           
pricebk.UseStandardPrice = false;            
insert pricebk;                  

//initialize the line item                                 
OpportunityLineItem oppLineItem = new OpportunityLineItem();         
oppLineItem.OpportunityId = oppty.Id;         
oppLineItem.PricebookEntryId = pricebk.Id;
