1. Always catch the CalloutException

try {
    //Execute web service call here
    HTTPResponse res = http.send(req);

    //Helpful debug messages
    System.debug(res.toString());
    System.debug('STATUS:'+res.getStatus());
    System.debug('STATUS_CODE:'+res.getStatusCode());
} catch(System.CalloutException e) {
    //Exception handling goes here.... retry the call, whatever
}

2. Always set the timeout on the callout:
The default timeout is 10 seconds. The minimum is 1 millisecond and the maximum is 120 seconds.

HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
req.setTimeout(60000); // timeout in milliseconds - this is one minute

There is a maximum cumulative timeout for callouts by a single Apex transaction (currently 120 seconds - see the Apex Language Reference Guide for a definitive number). This time is additive across all callouts invoked by the Apex transaction.
The Apex callout request size must be smaller than a set maximum limit.
A governor limit is set on the number of web service calls or callouts per trigger or Apex class invocation.
